# Chefbot_NCF

This repository is intended for managing conversations that are interfaced through an application like Google Dialogflow. While such applications are mostly useful for modelling single adjacency pairs in the conversation, Chefbot_NCF is developed to enable the modelling of extended conversation plans, such as instructing a cooking recipe (hence the name chefbot). It is inspired on the Natural Conversation Framework (NCF) proposed by Moore and Arar (2019), where the content of the conversation is detached from the act of conversing itself. Furthermore, the Information State Update paradigm (Larsson & Traum, 2000) is adopted to keep track of the conversation and enable dynamic conversation management. The patterns of conversational activities and sequences, as proposed by Moore, can be modelled through conversational moves, with their own preconditions and effects.
